# Phaser 3 RPG Game ‚öîÔ∏è

This is a simple RPG game built mostly from scratch using `Phaser 3`. Not sure what it's going to be like yet, but I'm sure it will be fun!

## The Todo üìã

- Dialogue system
  - Get something working ‚úÖ
  - make box spawn at the right position even when you have moved away
    - layer multiple scenes a solution?
      - [1](https://phaser.discourse.group/t/hud-scene-multiple-scenes/6348) 
      - [2](https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/scenes/ui-scene-es6)
  - make an interaction spawn dialogue
- Should all this logic be in the WorldScene?
  - After creating the TestScene, it is clear that it should not be.
- Get an idea of what the game will be about
  - generate more todos

### Known Issues ü¶ó

- my game is perfect ;]

### The Done ‚úÖ

- Set up Phaser 3 + TypeScript
- Add webpack
- Get a tiled map working
- Get a character working
  - movement
  - animations
  - idles
- Lock character movements to 16x16 grid
  - took a lot longer than I expected...
  - mirrors [Annoraaq's grid engine](https://github.com/Annoraaq/grid-engine)
- Add babel ü§∑ seems like not needed for our purposes
