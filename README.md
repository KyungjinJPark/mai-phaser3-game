# Phaser 3 RPG Game ⚔️

This is a simple RPG game built mostly from scratch using `Phaser 3`. Not sure what it's going to be like yet, but I'm sure it will be fun!

## The Todo 📋

- Dialogue system
  - make an interaction spawn dialogue
- Should all this logic be in the WorldScene?
  - After creating the TestScene, it is clear that it should not be.
- Get an idea of what the game will be about
  - generate more todos

### Known Issues 🦗

- my game is perfect ;]

### The Done ✅

- Set up Phaser 3 + TypeScript
- Add webpack
- Get a tiled map working
- Get a character working
  - movement
  - animations
  - idles
- Lock character movements to 16x16 grid
  - took a lot longer than I expected...
  - mirrors [Annoraaq's grid engine](https://github.com/Annoraaq/grid-engine)
- Add babel 🤷 seems like not needed for our purposes
