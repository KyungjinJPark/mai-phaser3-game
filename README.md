# Phaser 3 RPG Game ⚔️

This is a simple RPG game built mostly from scratch using `Phaser 3`. Not sure what it's going to be like yet, but I'm sure it will be fun!

## The Todo 📋

- Different interactions
  - ✔️ enter dialogue
    - ✔️ stops your movement
  - ✔️ cause animation
  - ✔️ transition scene
  - ✔️ move self
  - trigger other objects to do something
    - e.g.
      - move the player
      - make other play animation
  - do muiltiple above actions
- Pause menu
  - inventory
- GameManager
- Dialogue system
  - can go through dialogue without mouse
  - can respond
  - can offer different responses
- Animated tiles
- Depth sorting
- In-game cutscenes
- How to manage game animation creation and management

### Known Issues 🦗

- Activating Dialogue
  - twice doesn't work
  - thrice works but breaks your controls
- Movement controls go 💥 if you pause the game (and prob is you unfocus browser)
- NPCs with movementCommands won't
  - play interact animations
  - change their movement commands
- Dialogue stopping movement breaks on scene tranisition

### The Done ✅

- Set up Phaser 3 + TypeScript
- Add webpack
- Static maps from tiled
- Get a character working
  - movement
  - animations
  - idles
- Lock character movements to 16x16 grid
  - took a lot longer than I expected...
  - mirrors [Annoraaq's grid engine](https://github.com/Annoraaq/grid-engine)
- Add babel 🤷 seems like not needed for our purposes
- Dialogue system
  - get something working
  - make box spawn at the right position even when you have moved away
    - layer multiple scenes: TOOK ME FOREVER... didn't know how default draw order was determined. didn't know it was even a thing
  - dialogue spawning interaction 
  - many dialogue boxes can be spawned at once !?!?!?!? 🤯🤯🤯
- Should all this logic be in the TestScene?
  - after creating the TestScene, it is clear that it should not be. Refactor time!
    - Many refactors to be made 😰
- Did some TODOs
- Interactables still hardcoded in ObjectManager
- NPCs
  - generated by code
  - walk around randomly
    - w collisions
    - w animations
  - talk to them
  - make NPCs not all the same
- Many things to consider.
  - lots of TODOs
  - reconsider approach to composition
    - ❌ *Couldn't get TS mixins to enforce the proper constructor for chained mixins*
  - organize an order of initialization and dependency bind timings
  - typing interactionCommands & movementCommands
- Party
  - narty members follow you
  - not collidable to you or eachother, but are to everything else
  - Party class to abstract party logic from game input manager
- Scene transitions
  - saving scene state
  - load scene diffs based on save file
